What has been done:
 - Added SonarQube to docker-compose
    - unsure if postgres is necessary down the line, its not required for the image to run
 - Added SonarQube to Jenkinsfile
    - will need to be changed when we finally figure out how to get it working
What has been attempted:
 - Running SonarQube Locally
    - Create token on SonarQube
    - Add token to Jenkins credentials
    - Add SonarQube and Mavin tools to Jenkins tools
    - Add SonarQube installation to Jenkins system
 - Creating Jenkins pipeline using the Jenkinsfile and building
    - Doesn't work because it requires credentials for the github repo


UPDATE:
Sonarqube init added to setup-jenkins.groovy
Was unable to test if to works myself. When I docker compose, the pipeline isn't built in Jenkins. 
Could someone else try?
